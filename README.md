## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Use node v14

```bash
nvm install 16.14.2
# optionally make it a default version
nvm alias default 16
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed
on [http://localhost:4000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Development

### Tools we use

VSCode. We use this code editor in order to have the same set of tools available to us.
Prettier - Code formatter. With projects vs code settings this extension will format the code on each save.
ESLint - runs in pre-commit sequence. Will find issues with the code style, which can indicate an error.

We should improve our tools and their configuration over time. For example we can add more rules to eslint.
