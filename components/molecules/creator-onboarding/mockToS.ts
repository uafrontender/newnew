      You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and
      regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Site is revoked where these Terms or use of
      the Site is prohibited or to the extent offering or provision of the Site conflicts with any applicable

      of any third party.

      Account on the Site (an "Account"). You must provide accurate and complete information and keep your
      Account information updated. If you provide any information that is inaccurate, not current, or

      our sole discretion.

      of doubt, users may not "co-own" accounts on the Site. In the event NewNew determines that you have
      opened, maintained, used, or controlled more than one Account, in addition to any other rights that
      NewNew may have, NewNew reserves the right to suspend or terminate any or all of your accounts.

  <div>
    <p>

      prohibited.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h1>4. <strong>NewNew&rsquo;s Role</strong></h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>4.1</strong> NewNew provides a decision-making platform that lets users vote to control the
      outcome of other people&rsquo;s lives. When a creator posts a Creator Event (defined below) on our Site,
      they&rsquo;re inviting other people to form a contract with them. Supporters (as defined below) who
      support a Creator Event are accepting the Creator&rsquo;s offer, and forming that contract.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>4.2.</strong> NewNew is not a part of this contract&mdash;the contract is a direct legal
      agreement between Creators and their Supporters (the &ldquo;Creator Agreement&rdquo;). Here are the
      terms that govern the Creator Agreement:
    </p>
    <div>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          When the term of the Creator Event concludes, the Creator must complete the task that was selected
          by Supporters pursuant to that Creator Event&rsquo;s conditions. Once a Creator has done so,
          they&rsquo;ve satisfied their obligation to their Supporters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Throughout the process, Creators owe their Supporters a high standard of effort, honest
          communication, and a dedication to performing the task. At the same time, Supporters must understand
          that they&rsquo;re not buying something when they participate in a Creator Event&mdash;they are
          providing input as to what the Creator should do handle. There may be changes or delays, and
          there&rsquo;s a chance something could happen that prevents the Creator from being able to finish
          the task as promised.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a Creator is unable to complete the task, they&rsquo;ve failed to live up to the basic
          obligations of the Creator Agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find
          another way of completing the task to the best possible conclusion for the Supporters. A Creator in
          this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to Supporters if:
        </li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            They post an update that explains what has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them
            from finishing the task as planned;
          </li>
          <li>
            They&rsquo;re able to demonstrate that they&rsquo;ve used funds appropriately and made every
            reasonable effort to complete the task as promised;
          </li>
          <li>
            They&rsquo;ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to
            Supporters;
          </li>
          <li>
            They offer to return any remaining funds to Supporters who participated in the applicable Creator
            Event (in proportion to the amounts provided).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>4.3. </strong>The Creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made through their
      Creator Event. If they&rsquo;re unable to satisfy the terms of the Creator Agreement, they may be
      subject to legal action by their Supporters.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>4.4. </strong>NewNew doesn&rsquo;t become involved in disputes between users, or between users
      and any third party relating to the use of the Site. We don&rsquo;t oversee the performance or
      punctuality of completion of the Creator Events, and we don&rsquo;t endorse any content users submit to
      the Site. When you use the Site, you release NewNew from claims, damages, and demands of every
      kind&mdash;known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed&mdash;arising out of or
      in any way related to such disputes and the Site. All Content you access through the Site is at your own
      risk. You&rsquo;re solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h1>5. Creators on the Site</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.1. </strong>NewNew allows for certain users of the Site to ask the community for input on life
      choices (each a &ldquo;Creator&rdquo;, and collectively the &ldquo;Creators&rdquo;). Creators can upload
      a topic and solicit user feedback through one, or more, of the following mechanisms provided through our
      Site (each a &ldquo;Creator Event&rdquo;):
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Events</u></strong>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Supporters are provided with the option to send suggestions to the Creator on how the Creator should
      respond to a situation along with a specific dollar amount (a &ldquo;Bid&rdquo; and collectively, the
      &ldquo;Bids&rdquo;). Other Supporters can see the Bids submitted by other Supporters and can choose to
      submit their own Bid and/or pledge additional amounts to the Bid of another Supporter. Ultimately, the
      Creator has the sole discretion to select the Bid that the Creator agrees to perform, and receive the
      total amount pledged by all Supporters that supported that Bid. The amount pledged by Supporters whose
      Bids were not accepted is thereafter refunded to the applicable Supporters.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Goals</u></strong>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Creator agrees to perform a specific task if a minimum number of Supporters cumulatively pledge a
      minimum amount (the &ldquo;Goal&rdquo;). Supporters are then given the option to pledge two or more
      dollars toward the Goal. If the criteria for the Goal is met, the Creator receives the total amounts
      pledged and agrees to perform the task. If the criteria for the Goal is not met, the funds pledged by
      the applicable Supporters are released to the Supporters.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Superpolls</u></strong>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Creator uploads a topic and two to four different options on how the creator should respond to the
      topic. The Supporters are then given the option to pay a certain amount to cast a vote for one of the
      options. The Supporters can pay to vote additional times on one or more of the options. The Creator
      agrees to perform the option that received the most votes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.2. </strong><u><strong>Binding Agreement.</strong></u> You acknowledge and agree that your
      acceptance of any amount as part of a Creator Event, creates a direct agreement between you and your
      Supporters where you agree to fulfill your obligations set forth in that Creator Event, in accordance
      with these Terms and specifically as outlined in Section 4 above.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.3.</strong> <u><strong>Term of Creator Events and Payments.</strong></u> Each Creator Event
      shall run for a time period of seven days from the date the event goes live on our Site (the
      &ldquo;Event Term&rdquo;). During this time, Creators can solicit feedback and support from their
      Supporters. All funds related to the applicable Creator Event shall be held by NewNew&rsquo;s payment
      processor until the conclusion of the Event Term. NewNew shall try to provide timely access to your
      funds, but you may occasionally experience delays in accessing your funds. NewNew may also block or hold
      payments for violations of our policies or for compliance reasons, including collecting tax reporting
      information. When payments are delayed or blocked we try to communicate the reason to you promptly. If
      you have questions about a block, please reach out to us. In order to protect Creators, we may block
      Supporters&rsquo; payments if we believe them to be fraudulent. Sometimes activities like refunds can
      put your account balance into the negative. If your balance becomes negative then we reserve the right
      to recover those funds from future payments.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      NewNew&rsquo;s payment processor may also block and/or hold payments pursuant to their terms. Please see
      the section entitled
      <a href="/#e10b1305aac443e1908f981e9cc022db">Third Party Services and Resources</a> below for more
      information.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.4. </strong><u><strong>Taxes.</strong></u> We may deduct or withhold any taxes that we may be
      legally obligated to deduct or withhold from any payment made to you under this Agreement, and payment
      to you as reduced by such deductions or withholdings will constitute full payment and settlement to you
      of such payment under this Agreement.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.5. </strong
      ><u><strong>Creators can refund individual pledges at their sole discretion.</strong></u> After your
      Creator Event has been completed, Creators may cancel and refund a Supporter&rsquo;s pledge at any time.
      If a Creator does so, the Creator shall have no further obligation to that specific Supporter, and no
      agreement shall exist between them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.6. </strong><u><strong>Some pledges can&rsquo;t be collected, which might reduce the amount you get.</strong></u>
      Because some payments can&rsquo;t be collected, we can&rsquo;t guarantee that the amounts you receive
      from a Creator Event will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus our fees.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.7. </strong><strong><u>Eligibility. </u></strong>Persons under the age of eighteen (18) or the
      applicable age of majority in their legal state of residence (collectively, "Minors") are not eligible
      to become Creators on the Site. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Creator
      functionality to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.8. </strong><strong><u>Know Your Legal Obligations.</u></strong> As a Creator, you are
      responsible for understanding and complying with these Terms and our Community Guidelines along with any
      laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Creator Events. The
      information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should
      independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using the personal data of
      your Supporters and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms. If you have
      questions about how local laws apply, you should always seek legal advice.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>5.9. </strong><u><strong>Subscriptions.</strong></u> As a Creator, we may offer you the ability
      to permit Supporters to follow you by signing up for a paid subscription. Under such circumstance,
      Creator will determine the applicable monthly price of the subscription from a predetermined selection
      of prices provided by NewNew.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h1>6. Supports on the Site</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>6.1. </strong>NewNew allows for certain users of the Site to provide feedback on how to respond
      to life choices that will be made by Creators (each a &ldquo;Supporter&rdquo;, and collectively the
      &ldquo;Supporters&rdquo;). Supporters can participate in helping make these decisions by taking part in
      various kinds of Creator Events, where the Creator will post a topic to be considered and a method by
      which the Supporter can help the Creator decide. A description of specific types of Creator Events that
      a Supporter can participate in can be found in Section 5 of these Terms.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>6.2. </strong><u><strong>Account Holds.</strong></u> When you participate in a Creator Event
      through our Site, you agree that NewNew and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on
      your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full amount you pledged,
      and that such funds shall be held for the entire Event Term for the applicable Creator Event. Your
      payment will only be collected if, at the conclusion of the Event Term, your choice/suggestion was
      selected by the Creator and/or the Creator Event reached its Goal. If your choice was not selected, the
      held funds shall be released to you. Further, you are agreeing to pay all charges related to your pledge
      including the amount you pledge and any applicable fees, such as NewNew&rsquo;s payment
      processor&rsquo;s fees. You understand that it may take up to 5 business days from the conclusion of an
      Event Term for the hold to be released.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>6.3. </strong><strong><u>Know Your Legal Obligations.</u></strong> As a Supporter, you may
      participate in Creator Events and, in certain circumstances, provide your own suggestions for how a
      Creator should respond to a particular situation. As part of your participation in Creator Events, you
      agree that you are responsible for understanding and complying with these Terms and our Community
      Guidelines along with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to such
      Creator Events. The information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes
      only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using
      personal data of your Supporters and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms.
      If you have questions about how local laws apply, you should always seek legal advice.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <strong>6.4. </strong><strong><u>The estimated performance timeframe is the Creator&rsquo;s estimate.</u></strong> The
      Creator is given the choice of when to perform the results of a Creator Event. The timeframe specified
      by the Creator is an estimate and circumstances may change that prevent the Creator from fulfilling the
      task within that timeframe.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>

      taxes associated with your use of the Site.
