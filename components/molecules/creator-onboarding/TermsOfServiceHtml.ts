</p>
</div>
<h1>
4. <strong>NewNew’s Role</strong>
</h1>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>4.1.</strong>
  NewNew provides a decision-making platform that lets users vote to control the outcome of other people’s lives. When a creator posts a Creator Event (defined below) on our Site, they’re inviting other people to form a contract
  with them. Supporters (as defined below) who support a Creator Event are accepting the Creator’s offer, and forming that contract.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>4.2.</strong>
  NewNew is not a part of this contract—the contract is a direct legal agreement between Creators and their Supporters (the “Creator Agreement”). Here are the terms that govern the Creator Agreement:
</p>
<div>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      When the term of the Creator Event concludes, the Creator must complete the task that was selected by Supporters pursuant to that Creator Event’s conditions. Once a Creator has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to
      their Supporters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Throughout the process, Creators owe their Supporters a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to performing the task. At the same time, Supporters must understand that they’re not buying something
      when they participate in a Creator Event—they are providing input as to what the Creator should do handle. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the Creator from being able
      to finish the task as promised.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a Creator is unable to complete the task, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of the Creator Agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of completing the task to the
      best possible conclusion for the Supporters. A Creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to Supporters if:
    </li>
    <ul>
     <li>
      They post an update that explains what has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the task as planned;
    </li>
    <li>
      They’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the task as promised;
    </li>
    <li>
      They’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to Supporters; 
    </li>
    <li>
      They offer to return any remaining funds to Supporters who participated in the applicable Creator Event (in proportion to the amounts provided).
    </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>4.3. </strong>
  The Creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made through their Creator Event. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of the Creator Agreement, they may be subject to legal action by their Supporters.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>4.4. </strong>
  NewNew doesn’t become involved in disputes between users, or between users and any third party relating to the use of the Site. We don’t oversee the performance or punctuality of completion of the Creator Events, and we don’t
  endorse any content users submit to the Site. When you use the Site, you release NewNew from claims, damages, and demands of every kind—known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed—arising out of or in any
  way related to such disputes and the Site. All Content you access through the Site is at your own risk. You’re solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.
</p>
</div>
<h1>
5. Creators on the Site
</h1>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>5.1. </strong>
  NewNew allows for certain users of the Site to ask the community for input on life choices (each a “Creator”, and collectively the “Creators”). Creators can upload a topic and solicit user feedback through one, or more, of the
  following mechanisms provided through our Site (each a “Creator Event”):
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <u><strong>Bids</strong></u>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  The Supporters are provided with the option to send suggestions to the Creator on how the Creator should respond to a situation along with a specific dollar amount (a “Bid” and collectively, the “Bids”). Other Supporters can see
  the Bids submitted by other Supporters and can choose to submit their own Bid and/or pledge additional amounts to the Bid of another Supporter. Ultimately, the Creator has the sole discretion to select the Bid that the Creator
  agrees to perform, and receive the total amount pledged by all Supporters that supported that Bid. The amount pledged by Supporters whose Bids were not accepted is thereafter refunded to the applicable Supporters.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong><u>Superpolls</u></strong>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  The Creator uploads a topic and two to four different options on how the creator should respond to the topic. The Supporters are then given the option to pay a certain amount to cast a vote for one of the options. The Supporters
  can pay to vote additional times on one or more of the options. The Creator agrees to perform the option that received the most votes.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>5.2. </strong>
  <u><strong>Binding Agreement.</strong></u>
  <strong> </strong>
  You acknowledge and agree that your acceptance of any amount as part of a Creator Event, creates a direct agreement between you and your Supporters where you agree to fulfill your obligations set forth in that Creator Event, in
  accordance with these Terms and specifically as outlined in Section 4 above.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>5.3.</strong> 
  <u><strong>Term of Creator Events and Payments.</strong></u>
  <strong> </strong>
  Each Creator Event shall run for a time period of seven days from the date the event goes live on our Site (the “Event Term”). During this time, Creators can solicit feedback and support from their Supporters. All funds related to
  the applicable Creator Event shall be held by NewNew’s payment processor until the conclusion of the Event Term. NewNew shall try to provide timely access to your funds, but you may occasionally experience delays in accessing your
  funds. NewNew may also block or hold payments for violations of our policies or for compliance reasons, including collecting tax reporting information. When payments are delayed or blocked we try to communicate the reason to you
  promptly. If you have questions about a block, please reach out to us. In order to protect Creators, we may block Supporters’ payments if we believe them to be fraudulent. Sometimes activities like refunds can put your account
  balance into the negative. If your balance becomes negative then we reserve the right to recover those funds from future payments.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  NewNew’s payment processor may also block and/or hold payments pursuant to their terms. Please see the section entitled 
  <a  href="/#block-e10b1305aac443e1908f981e9cc022db">Third Party Services and Resources</a> below for more information.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>5.4. </strong>
  <u><strong>Taxes.</strong></u>
  <strong> </strong>
  We may deduct or withhold any taxes that we may be legally obligated to deduct or withhold from any payment made to you under this Agreement, and payment to you as reduced by such deductions or withholdings will constitute full
  payment and settlement to you of such payment under this Agreement.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>5.5. </strong>
  <u><strong>Creators can refund individual pledges at their sole discretion.</strong></u>
  <strong> </strong>
  After your Creator Event has been completed, Creators may cancel and refund a Supporter’s pledge at any time. If a Creator does so, the Creator shall have no further obligation to that specific Supporter, and no agreement shall
  exist between them.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>5.6. </strong>
  <u><strong>Some pledges can’t be collected, which might reduce the amount you get.</strong></u>
  <strong> </strong>Because some payments can’t be collected, we can’t guarantee that the amounts you receive from a Creator Event will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus our fees.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>5.7. </strong>
  <strong><u>Eligibility. </u></strong>
  Persons under the age of eighteen (18) or the applicable age of majority in their legal state of residence (collectively, "Minors") are not eligible to become Creators on the Site. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer
  the Creator functionality to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>5.8. </strong>
  <strong><u>Know Your Legal Obligations.</u></strong>
  <strong> </strong>
  As a Creator, you are responsible for understanding and complying with these Terms and our Community Guidelines along with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Creator Events. The
  information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using the personal data of your Supporters and
  others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms. If you have questions about how local laws apply, you should always seek legal advice.
</p>
</div>
<h1>
6. Supports on the Site
</h1>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>6.1. </strong>
  NewNew allows for certain users of the Site to provide feedback on how to respond to life choices that will be made by Creators (each a “Supporter”, and collectively the “Supporters”). Supporters can participate in helping make
  these decisions by taking part in various kinds of Creator Events, where the Creator will post a topic to be considered and a method by which the Supporter can help the Creator decide. A description of specific types of Creator
  Events that a Supporter can participate in can be found in Section 5 of these Terms.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>6.2. </strong>
  <u><strong>Account Holds.</strong></u>
  <strong> </strong>
  When you participate in a Creator Event through our Site, you agree that NewNew and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full
  amount you pledged, and that such funds shall be held for the entire Event Term for the applicable Creator Event. Your payment will only be collected if, at the conclusion of the Event Term, your choice/suggestion was selected by
  the Creator and/or the Creator Event reached its benchmark. If your choice was not selected, the held funds shall be released to you. Further, you are agreeing to pay all charges related to your pledge including the amount you
  pledge and any applicable fees, such as NewNew’s payment processor’s fees. You understand that it may take up to 5 business days from the conclusion of an Event Term for the hold to be released.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>6.3. </strong>
  <strong><u>Know Your Legal Obligations.</u></strong>
  <strong> </strong>
  As a Supporter, you may participate in Creator Events and, in certain circumstances, provide your own suggestions for how a Creator should respond to a particular situation. As part of your participation in Creator Events, you
  agree that you are responsible for understanding and complying with these Terms and our Community Guidelines along with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to such Creator Events. The
  information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of your Supporters and others
  in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms. If you have questions about how local laws apply, you should always seek legal advice.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>6.4. </strong>
  <strong><u>The estimated performance timeframe is the Creator’s estimate.</u></strong>
  <strong> </strong>
  The Creator is given the choice of when to perform the results of a Creator Event. The timeframe specified by the Creator is an estimate and circumstances may change that prevent the Creator from fulfilling the task within that
  timeframe.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>6.5. </strong>
  <strong><u>No refunds.</u></strong>
  <strong> </strong>NewNew doesn’t hold funds on Creators’ behalf, cannot guarantee Creators’ performance, and does not offer refunds.
</p>
</div>
<h1>
7. Our Fees
</h1>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>7.1.</strong>
  Creating an account on the Site is free. When a Creator receives payment related to a Creator Event, we collect a 20% fee from the total amount that Creator receives. We’ll charge our fees before releasing the funds related to the
  applicable Creator Event to that Creator’s account. You are responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of the Site.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
  <strong>7.2. </strong>
  If our fees ever change, we’ll announce that on our Site. Funds pledged by Supporters are collected by payment processors. Each payment processor is its own company, and NewNew isn’t responsible for its performance.
</p>

  COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES. BECAUSE THE SITE CONCERNS INTERSTATE COMMERCE, THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT ("FAA") GOVERNS THE ARBITRABILITY OF ALL DISPUTES. HOWEVER, APPLICABLE CALIFORNIA
  STATE OR U.S. FEDERAL LAW MAY ALSO APPLY TO THE SUBSTANCE OF ANY DISPUTES. THE ARBITRATION SHALL TAKE PLACE IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, OR IN THE CITY NEAREST TO OUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS WHERE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION

  BY THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES (AND AS STATED THEREIN, IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES, THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES
  WILL BE USED). YOU AND WE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU OR WE HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE BROUGHT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO
  BE SUBJECT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION THEREOF AND WAIVE ANY CLAIM OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS OR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION THAT YOU OR WE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE.

  AND CONTENT ON THE SITE, TO THE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, MATERIALS, PROGRAMS OR OTHER FEATURES OFFERED, ADVERTISED, MARKETED, SOLD AND/OR MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE, AND/OR TO THESE TERMS WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY,
  WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION. YOU SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHER USERS/CONSUMERS OR ARBITRATE, AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY
  GENERAL CAPACITY, ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR CAUSE OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATED TO THE SITE, TO THE USE THEREOF OR ACCESS THERETO, TO PARTICIPATION IN A CREATOR EVENT OR OTHER SITE RELATED ACTIVITY/OPPORTUNITY, TO THE
